I subscribed to the 300Mbps plan but only getting around 50-60Mbps even with direct LAN connection","Our diagnostics show signal attenuation in your fiber line. We've detected micro-bends at two junction points that are causing signal loss. We've scheduled a technician visit for tomorrow between 9 AM-12 PM to replace the affected cable segments. In the meantime, we've adjusted your signal amplification remotely which should improve speeds to around 150Mbps temporarily. Once the physical cable is replaced, you should achieve the full 300Mbps consistently.

This happens when 'Use Less Data for Calls' is disabled in WhatsApp settings. We've reversed the charges totaling ₹785 as a goodwill gesture and added a notification flag to your account to alert you if similar patterns emerge in the future.

Our diagnostics show your main router is positioned in the ground floor living room, creating signal shadows on the upper floor. We can offer a Jio Mesh system at ₹3499 (or ₹299/month rental) with free professional installation. The mesh system creates a seamless network with the same SSID throughout your home.

We've sent a configuration SMS to help with automatic setup. We've also noted your new device (Samsung Galaxy S25) in our system for troubleshooting purposes.

After analyzing your connection, we've identified minor packet loss during peak hours. We've applied these optimizations to your account: 1) Configured your line for reduced latency rather than maximum throughput, 2) Assigned a static IP address to prevent IP reassignment delays, 3) Optimized DNS settings for faster game server connections. These changes should reduce your ping by approximately 30-40%. For best results, we also recommend connecting your gaming system via ethernet rather than Wi-Fi and adjusting your router's QoS settings to prioritize gaming traffic.

This effectively costs ₹256/month compared to the ₹299 monthly plan with similar benefits but only 28-day validity. You'll save approximately ₹520 annually with this option. Since you mentioned evening calls, this plan also includes free night data (12AM-6AM) that doesn't count against your daily quota - perfect for downloading large updates or streaming during off-peak hours.

The charges occurred because your device connected to a partner network (Airtel) in areas where Jio's direct coverage was limited. While nationwide roaming is indeed free on Jio's network, partner network usage in specific terrain-challenged areas incurs nominal charges. As a goodwill gesture, we've reversed these charges entirely. For future hill station travel, we recommend enabling the 'Jio Network Only' setting in your phone's network selection menu to prevent automatic switching to partner networks. Alternatively, you can activate our 'Himalayan Regions Pack' for Rs.49, which provides 7-day unrestricted roaming across all networks in mountainous regions. We've also added this region to our priority network expansion list based on increasing customer travel patterns.",1.0,4,AG-134

Will my Jio connection work on the ship?","Regarding your upcoming cruise from Mumbai to Dubai (June 10-17), we've checked that your vessel (MSC Bellissima) is equipped with maritime cellular services. Jio has roaming agreements with maritime providers, but please note: 1) Connectivity is available only when the ship is in international waters (12+ nautical miles from shore), 2) Maritime roaming rates are significantly higher than standard international roaming (Rs.30/MB for data, Rs.25/minute for calls), 3) Signal may be intermittent based on weather and ship's position. We recommend activating our 'Maritime Travel Pack' for Rs.999 which includes 1GB data and 30 minutes of calls valid for 7 days, saving approximately 60% over standard maritime rates. When near ports or coastlines, your phone will connect to land-based networks where our standard international roaming packs apply. For continuous connectivity, the ship offers WiFi packages which may be more economical for extended usage. Your account has been flagged for maritime access, so no special activation is required.",0.9,4,AG-136

The installation complies with Department of Telecommunications guidelines, operating at less than 10% of the radiation limits prescribed by WHO and ICNIRP (International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection). All our towers undergo quarterly radiation audits by independent third parties. This particular installation is a 'small cell' design with lower power output than traditional towers, specifically engineered for dense urban environments. The primary benefit for your location will be enhanced indoor coverage and consistent 5G speeds. If you have specific concerns, we can arrange for a radiation measurement at your residence by our technical team at no cost. Scientific consensus from major health organizations indicates no evidence of adverse health effects from mobile towers operating within regulatory limits, which our installations strictly adhere to.",1.0,3,AG-123

Your location (Dharchula, Uttarakhand) is indeed within 3km of the international border, causing occasional automatic connection to Ncell (Nepal) network. To address this immediately: 1) We've applied a Rs.4,789 credit to reverse all international charges from the past 60 days, 2) Activated 'Border Zone Protection' on your account which prevents automatic international roaming, 3) Pushed a network preference update to your device to prioritize Indian networks even at lower signal strength. For a permanent solution, please update your phone's network selection to 'Manual' or 'Jio Only' mode through Settings > Mobile Network > Network Selection. We're also expediting the deployment of a new tower in your area next month which will strengthen our signal coverage by approximately 40%.

JIO-T1152,CUST-1973,2025-05-27,Network,Weather Impact,Medium,"My network quality deteriorates significantly whenever it rains. Is this normal?","Your observation about network quality degradation during rainfall is correct and not uncommon. Analysis of your connection data shows a 35-45% decrease in signal strength during moderate to heavy rainfall at your location (Kharghar, Navi Mumbai). This occurs because rainfall above certain intensities (particularly >10mm/hour) can absorb and scatter radio signals in the frequency bands used by mobile networks. We've optimized your connection to automatically switch to lower frequency bands during detected rainfall, which should improve reliability at the expense of peak speeds. To further address this: 1) We've prioritized your area for our 'Weather-Resilient Network' upgrade scheduled next month, which includes advanced rain-fade compensation technology, 2) Provided a complimentary 3-month subscription to our JioCloud service to ensure critical data backups continue even during connectivity fluctuations, and 3) Configured your account to receive proactive SMS alerts when heavy rainfall is expected in your area. For immediate improvement, we recommend positioning your device away from windows during rainfall and considering a signal booster for your home.",0.9,4,AG-124

This enables your device to connect to any available network (Airtel/Vi/BSNL) in your current remote location (Spiti Valley) for the next 72 hours at no additional cost. Our records show your device is currently connected to BSNL network with limited coverage (2G/3G only). To maximize reliability: 1) Keep your phone in a higher elevation if possible, 2) Send text messages rather than calls as they require less signal strength, 3) Configure your phone to '2G Only' mode temporarily as this has better range than 3G/4G in mountainous terrain. We've also notified our network partner in Himachal Pradesh to prioritize any communications from your number. Your emergency contacts (registered in your MyJio app) have been automatically notified of your situation and approximate location. Once you return to a Jio coverage area, your connection will automatically normalize. A Jio representative will personally follow up within 24 hours to confirm your safety.",0.7,5,AG-138

Could something be blocking the signal?","Our analysis confirms your Jio connection experiences significant degradation specifically in your office building (Magarpatta City, Pune). Signal mapping shows your signal drops from -65dBm outside the building to -115dBm inside, suggesting structural interference. Modern office buildings often use Low-E (low emissivity) glass and metal structural elements that can block cellular signals. We've dispatched a technical team to conduct a site survey at your office on May 30th (appointment confirmed). Potential solutions include: 1) Installation of a Indoor Signal Booster (Rs.2,499, one-time cost), 2) Implementation of a DAS (Distributed Antenna System) for your entire office floor (typically arranged through your company's facilities management), or 3) A complementary JioFi portable hotspot that can be placed near windows to capture external signal and redistribute it inside. In the meantime, we've optimized your connection profile to use Band 8 (900MHz), which has better building penetration characteristics than the default bands.

This includes: 1) 30GB data valid across all 5 countries (approximately 2GB/day based on your travel duration), 2) Unlimited incoming calls, 3) 300 minutes of local calls within these countries, 4) 100 minutes for calls back to India, and 5) 100 SMS. This pack offers seamless connectivity across all countries without needing to activate separate packs. Based on your regular usage patterns, we've calculated this should comfortably cover your needs while saving 35% compared to individual country packs. We've also configured your account for automatic network selection optimization to ensure you connect to our strongest partner network in each location. The pack automatically activates when you first land in Europe and remains active for 15 days.

Is there network maintenance happening?","You're correct about the consistent speed reduction during 10PM-1AM. Our network analytics confirm your area (Whitefield, Bangalore) experiences a 60-70% increase in network utilization during these hours, causing your speeds to drop from average 45Mbps to 12-15Mbps. This is not due to maintenance but rather peak usage patterns in your primarily residential area. Specifically, recent data shows streaming services accounting for 76% of this evening traffic surge. We've implemented two immediate solutions for you: 1) Enabled 'Smart QoS' on your connection which prioritizes your active applications over background data during congested periods, and 2) Activated 'Night Bridge' which temporarily shifts your connection to less congested frequency bands during peak hours. For your specific usage (primarily video conferencing around 11PM), we recommend scheduling bandwidth-intensive activities before 9:30PM or after 1:15AM when possible. Additionally, we're fast-tracking capacity expansion in your area with two new towers going live by June 15th, which should increase overall network capacity by 45%.",0.9,4,AG-126

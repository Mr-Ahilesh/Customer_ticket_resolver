Our diagnostics confirm your optical signal strength is excellent, but your home network configuration is causing buffering. We've applied these fixes: 1) Prioritized your Set-Top Box traffic through QoS settings in your router, 2) Switched your TV stream to a more efficient codec that requires less bandwidth without quality loss, 3) Assigned your entertainment devices to a dedicated network band to reduce interference. These changes have been applied remotely to your router. Please restart your Set-Top Box to apply the changes. If the issue persists, we may need to upgrade your router to our dual-core processor model which handles multiple HD streams more efficiently.",0,,AUTO
